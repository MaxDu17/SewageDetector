# SewageDetector
This project is the code for a funny little invention of mine. I created a device that uses capacitance to detect the level of water in a sewer pipe and sounds an alarm if the pipe is completely full (indicating a clog). It is deployed on my childhood home, which often suffers from sewer line clogs.
